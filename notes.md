##Next JS

- Next js is handled by vercel 
- It rids the problems with React like:
    - SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
    - Server side Rendering
    - bundle up the code and make it compact


##Layouts 
- if we want to give some comman thing to some of our pages we can add it to a single folder and add layout component in it and add that perticular functionality inside it
- it'll change the routing btw
- to overcome it just name the folder (folder_name) and it'll ignore the name of the folder and helps to render the page without folder name
