# NEXT JS

- Next js is handled by vercel 
- It rids the problems with React like:
    - SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
    - Server side Rendering
    - bundle up the code and make it compact


## Features of Next JS

- Full Stack framework
- Search engine Optimization
- File based Routing
- Server Side Rendering
- Single Codebase

## Layouts 
- if we want to give some comman thing to some of our pages we can add it to a single folder and add layout component in it and add that perticular functionality inside it
- it'll change the routing btw
- to overcome it just name the folder (folder_name) and it'll ignore the name of the folder and helps to render the page without folder name    

## Routing
- We can make Routes by create subfolders inside app directory
- for - www.test.com/signup -> we have to create a sub-folder inside app folder and name it signup and then inside it we have to create a page.tsx file
